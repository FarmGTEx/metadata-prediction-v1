# metadata-prediction-v1

This pipeline was used to find out the mislabeled samples and predict the missing phenotypes (such as sex, developmental stage, tissue, and so on) in FarmGTEx.

The pipeline included three parts:
  1. Saturated computation
  2. Classifcation method comparison
  3. Missing phenotype prediction
